This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# First Steps

Clone this repo and run `npm install` + `npm dev` to get started.

# Challenge

Welcome! In this product engineering code challenge, we'll be building the first two pages of our new "Buy a house" flow.

You'll use the three data sources in [`/data`](data) to satisfy the designs for these pages, found in [`/design`](design). I will play the role of your product manager / designer, answering any questions about about specs/scope, in addition to collaborating with you as an engineer.

A few things to note:

-   ‚è≥ We'll spend ~5 minutes setting things up, 50 minutes on the exercise, and ~5 minutes discussing it.

-   ‚öñÔ∏è Functional correctness is most important; pixel-perfection is not. These designs are intentionally low-fidelity.

-   üôÜ This exercise is designed to be a stretch for the time allowed. While we are evaluating completeness, it's OK if everything's not implemented at the 55-minute mark: we'll just discuss how you'd complete the remaining requirements if you had more time.

-   ü§î Ask questions just like you would if you were working with a product manager / designer. For example: How important is that map, really?

-   ‚ú® Feel free to import and use any third-party libraries, and consult the internet as needed -- just like you would normally.

-   ü§ñ You can find CSV & JSON parsers for the data sources in `lib/parse`

Let's start by diving into the `/design` folder and talking requirements!

# Development

To initialize

```
npm install
```

To run

```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
